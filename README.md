To run this program, open the Unreal Editor 5.0.3 and select SideScrollerTemplate.uproject and when asked to build the missing files press yes.

When in the editor, run the game and use A and D to move left and right respectively. Use W to jump. In the game you will come across flat square launch pads that will each have an arrow pointing in a different direction for each and each have a unique color. When the player collides with these launch pads they will be launched in the direction of the arrow and the velocity of each launch will differ depending on which launch pad you hit. When they launch the player, they will give off a flame particle effect for two seconds and also rotate themselves 90 degrees and back while the particle afftect goes.
